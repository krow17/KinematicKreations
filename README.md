# L-8 Toy
Senior Design capstone project at Texas A&M University.

# Purpose
This project was assigned to my senior design team by my professor, who received the request from a professor/researcher in the College of Architecture at Texas A&M University. Her request was simply that we digitize one of her inventions called the "L-8 Toy". The application was designed to be launched on the iPad.
